# Particle Detection Prototype

The Particle Detection Prototype is an optical device to measure the size distribution of nanosized particles in water.
We are building this device at the [Lili's Proto Lab](https://lilis-protolab.sites.uu.nl/) at Utrecht University.

In this repository, we are documenting the current state and software that is developed to make the device work.
